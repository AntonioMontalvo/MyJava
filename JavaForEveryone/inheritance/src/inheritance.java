public class inheritance {
    //Inheritance is the relationship between specialized and general classes. The general class is called a 'Superclass'
    //the specialized is called a 'Subclass'. A good example to illustrate this relationship is to look at the relationship
    //between vehicles and cars as the class Vehicle is the Superclass and the class Car is a subclass of Vehicle.

    //We will explore the concept of Inheritance with another example. A quiz consisting of questions, with different types
    //of questions.

    //At the root of the hierarchy is the Question type. Notice how the class is consider a type. Behind at the root the Question
    //class becomes the 'Superclass'. As a class it will have a couple of instance variables, a constructor and 4 methods. One to
    //set the question text, one to set the answer, one to check the answer and aone to display the question.
