There may be situations where you need to execute a block of code several number of times. Normally, statements are executes in secquence...the first statement is executed first, followed by the second, etc.

With Loops we can control our execution path, hence allowing more complicate structures.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.

Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. Java supports:
	
	1. break statements: to terminate the loop or switch statement and transfer execution to the statement following the loop or switch

	2. continue statement: which causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately jump to the next iteration of the loop.
